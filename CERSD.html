  <h1>3MT Competition</h1>
  <div class="indent">

      <h3> About Event </h3><br>
      <p> Three Minute Thesis (3MT)  is a research communication competition developed by The University
          of Queensland (UQ) which challenges research higher degree students to present a compelling
          oration on their thesis and its significance in just three minutes in language appropriate to a non-
          specialist audience. </p> <br>

      <h3> Eligibility </h3> <br>
      <p> All Civil Engineering students are eligible </p><br>

      <h3>Rules </h3>

      <ol style="padding : 20px;">
        <li> Presentations are limited to 3 minutes and competitors exceeding 3 minutes are disqualified. </li>
        <li> Presentations are considered to have commenced when a presenter starts their presentation through
             speech (timing does not include the 3MT title slide and commences from when the competitor starts speaking, not the start of the video). </li>
        <li> Videos must meet the following criteria: </li>
          <ol style="padding : 20px;">
            <li> Filmed on the horizontal; </li>
            <li> Filmed on a plain background; </li>
            <li> Filmed from a static position; </li>
            <li> Filmed from one camera angle; </li>
            <li> Contain a 3MT title slide; </li>
            <li> Contain a 3MT PowerPoint slide (top right corner/right side) </li>
          </ol>
        <li> A single static slide is permitted in the presentation (no slide transitions, animations or ‘movement’ of any description).
             This can be visible continuously, or ‘cut to’ (as many times as you like) for a maximum of 1 minute or submitted via email if not included in the presentation. </li>
        <li> The 3 minute audio must be continuous – no sound edits or breaks. </li>
        <li> No additional props (e.g. costumes, musical instruments, laboratory equipment and
             animated backgrounds) are permitted within the recording. </li>
        <li> Presentations are to be spoken word (e.g. no poems, raps or songs). </li>
        <li> No additional electronic media (e.g. sound and video files) are permitted within the video recording. </li>
        <li> The decision of the adjudicating panel is final. </li>
        <li> Submissions via video format (only video link provided to Event Coordinators). Files sent in other formats will not be accepted. </li>
        <li> Entries submitted for final adjudication to Wildcard or University Final are to be submitted
             from the School/ Faculty/Institute 3MT Event Coordinator. Competitors should not submit their videos directly to 3MT. </li>
      </ol>

      <p> Please note: competitors *will not* be judged on video/ recording quality or editing capabilities
          (optional inclusions). Judging will focus on the presentation, ability to communicate research to a
          non-specialist audience, and 3MT PowerPoint slide. </p> <br><br>

      <h3> Judging Criteria </h3> <br>
      <h4> Comprehension and Content </h4>
      <ol style="padding : 20px;">
        <li> Did the presentation provide an understanding of the background and significance to the
             research question being addressed, while explaining terminology and avoiding jargon? </li>
        <li> Did the presentation clearly describe the impact and/or results of the research, including conclusions and outcomes? </li>
        <li> Did the presentation follow a clear and logical sequence? </li>
        <li> Was the thesis topic, research significance, results/impact and outcomes communicated in
            language appropriate to a non-specialist audience? </li>
        <li> Did the presenter spend adequate time on each element of their presentation - or did they
             elaborate for too long on one aspect or was the presentation rushed? </li>
      </ol>

      <h4> Engagement and Communication </h4>
      <ol style="padding : 20px;">
        <li> Did the oration make the audience want to know more? </li>
        <li> Was the presenter careful not to trivialise or generalise their research? </li>
        <li> Did the presenter convey enthusiasm for their research? </li>
        <li> Did the presenter capture and maintain their audience's attention? </li>
        <li>Did the speaker have sufficient stage presence, eye contact and vocal range; maintain a steady pace, and have a confident stance? </li>
        <li> Did the PowerPoint slide enhance the presentation - was it clear, legible, and concise? </li>
      </ol>
